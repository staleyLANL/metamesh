This directory contains some example codes.

The author was able to compile the examples with the "runme" script. Modify
the script in an appropriate way for your system.

In their present form, the example codes require that you make available the
author's "kip" ray tracing library. Use the compiler's -I option to indicate
where kip's source code is located.

You can run the "clean" script to delete object files and executables that
were created by the compilation script.

The test/ directory (at the same level as this example/ directory) contains
test codes that could also be regarded as examples of how to use Metamesh.

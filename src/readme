This directory contains the source files that comprise the Metamesh library.

Include metamesh.h in your own code. It includes the other files, in their
proper order. Be sure that this directory is known to the compiler when you
compile your code. On many compilers, this is done with the -I option.

Metamesh is a "header-only" library. Therefore, these files are all that you
need in order to use every feature Metamesh provides.
